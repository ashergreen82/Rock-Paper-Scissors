## **Summary**

A rock-paper-scissor's game!!  Loads of fun and exciting for only a few minutes! LOL!\
I had already created a CLI version in Python, and I always wanted to create a GUI version.\
Lo and behold, while learning Javascript, my assignment was to create a rock-paper-scissors game.\
So I guess this is my GUI version.
